     <h2>This is my Scratch 1.1.7 Project! With Scratch, we created a game that deals with a cat; the cat needs to avoid getting hit by the balls to prevent gettting moved back to the original starting point! There are about 5 backgrounds on our game!

     <h2>This is my TicTacToe game! We used Mit App Inventor. It's similar to Scratch, but is a bit more advanced, and has a few more features! In our game, players can play Tic Tac Toe against each other. 
	 We also added sound; when the "Reset" button is clicked, the song "Crab Rave" will play. Enjoy!
